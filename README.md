Repository for the Recipes project

This project is a basic webpage showcasing three of my favorite recipes. 
It is an exercise in the fundamentals of HTML, including setting up the HTML
boilerplate, using HTML tags, formatting text with paragraphs and headings, 
using strong and em elements, formatting lists, adding images, and using both 
absolute and relative links. It is also a way to practice the Git workflow, 
including writing commit messages and pushing to GitHub.
