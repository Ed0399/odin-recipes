  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan province, but it is also enjoyed elsewhere in Asia. This recipe is a Japanese take on the dish taken from <strong><a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/mapo-tofu/">Just One Cookbook</a></strong>, a website that specializes in easy Japanese recipes. This dish quickly entered into my family's dinner menu rotation, as it is simple to make, hearty, and very flavourful. It is not as spicy as the Chinese version, which is perfect for those in my family with lower tolerance for spice, but you can add chili or peppercorns if you'd like.</p>
  
  <p>One ingredient you might have trouble finding is <strong><em>la doubanjiang</em></strong>, which is a <strong>spicy fermented broad bean paste.</strong> The original recipe uses both <em>la doubanjiang</em> and its non-spicy variant <em>doubanjiang</em>, but I typically substitute the non-spicy paste for other variants, such as Korean soybean paste. However, <em>la doubanjiang</em> provides spicy, salty, and umami flavours, so <strong>I highly recommend not substituting this ingredient.</strong> You can find it at your local Asian grocery store, and I've even seen it at Walmart. Your efforts will pay off with an easy yet satisfying rice bowl dish!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>Note: these are the proportions for 4 servings/bowls of tofu; for a bigger crowd, or if you like your rice bowls with a lot of topping, you should double or even triple the recipe.</p>

    <li>1 tablespoon neutral-flavoured oil (vegetable, canola, etc.)</li>
    <li>250 grams ground pork (you can use other meat and veggies of your choice</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>For the Seasoning</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon <em>la doubanjiang</em> (spicy broad bean paste)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoon <em>doubanjiang</em> (broad bean paste) or Korean bean paste (if you want a spicier dish, replace this with an equal amount of <em>la doubanjiang)</em></li>
